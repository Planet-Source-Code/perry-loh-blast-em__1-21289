### Description

It's a screen saver like application that has little people running around your screen. What you can do is blast them with a shotgun, and just watch the mess ;) I'm not promoting violence, just something I wrote for fun. It uses DirectX as a fullscreen app. I had wanted it to be more cool, like the little people "eating" up the desktop, maybe I'll do that later :) Vote if you like it!
